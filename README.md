# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  I Used D3 to read 'samples.json', then created a bar chart from the imported information.  Then I created a Bubble chart to better visualize  the 'otu_ids'.  By assigning a different color to each id. 

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
